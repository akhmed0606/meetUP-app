## âš™ Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [React](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Local Storage](https://javascript.info/)
- [React Testing Library] (https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

**Why I built the project this way**

- Styled components is a great library for styling which I really like, but in this project I used
  CSS Modules, because there are not that much styles applied.
- My plan is become a full-stack developer eventually. But for beginning I focus on the frontend. That's why
  I decided to use Local Storage Api to save favorite meatups and Firebase to get bit of backend experience also.
- Testing is essential part of the production application. Testing library is the go-to library in React community.
  I covered some essential features of the app with tests.
